Description             : These textures were intended for Kingpin, but were never used. As a
			  result they were put on the public domain, in Targa (TGA) form at
			  leadpipe.poisonville.com. To quote from there:

			Original Kingpin textures that never made it into the game. When you 
			unzip it, you'll see that the textures are all categorized exactly as 
			the other Kingpin textures are (bricks, bricks2, etc.). The problem with
			this is that some of these textures have the same file name as textures 
			that already exist in the Kingpin directory. My advice is to unzip this
			file onto your desktop, and go from there.

* How to Use *

Extract the WAD file into your usual storage for them. See your editor's help for further
information.

* Other Info *

Apparently some of these textures use the same names as the Kingpin originals.

There are 219 textures in this file. All were converted using TexMex v2.8, although some of the
original TGA files were converted incorrectly; flourescent red foliage anyone? :) So those
were converted to 256-colour BMPs first.

What appeared to be water textures were set as such. However a few of them are larger than
normal (128x128) so you may get a strange moire effect.

* Copyright / Permissions *

Authors may use these textures provided they credit Xatrix for them.

You MAY distribute this file through any electronic network (internet, FIDO, local BBS etc.), 
provided you include this file and leave the archive intact.
